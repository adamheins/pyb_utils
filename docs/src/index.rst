pyb_utils: utilities for PyBullet
=================================

*pyb_utils* is a collection of utilities I've found useful for working and
doing research with PyBullet.

Installation
------------
This package requires at least **Python 3.8**. It has been tested on Ubuntu
16.04, 18.04, 20.04, and 24.04. Install with pip: ``pip install pyb_utils``.

The source code and README can be found `here
<https://github.com/adamheins/pyb_utils>`_, with example scripts in the
``examples/`` directory. There are also a couple of blog posts describing some
of the features (see `here
<https://adamheins.com/blog/collision-detection-pybullet>`__ and `here
<https://adamheins.com/blog/new-features-in-pyb-utils>`__).
