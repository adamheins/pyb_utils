# pyb_utils: utilities for PyBullet

This is a collection of utilities I've found useful for working with PyBullet,
including:
* Collision detection: conveniently set up shortest distance computations and
  collision checking between arbitrary objects in arbitrary configurations with
  PyBullet. See the accompanying [blog post](https://adamheins.com/blog/collision-detection-pybullet).
* Ghost objects: add purely visual objects to the simulation, optionally
  attached to another body.
* Camera: virtual camera from which to get RGBA, depth, segmentation, and point
  cloud data. Also provides video recording using OpenCV.
* Convenience class for easily creating rigid bodies.
* Versions of some PyBullet functions that return *named* tuples, for easy
  field access.
* Basic quaternion functions.

## Documentation

The project's documentation is available [here](https://pyb-utils.readthedocs.io).

## Usage and examples
This package provides a few basic quality-of-life utilities. First, PyBullet
represents rotations using quaternions (in `[x, y, z, w]` order). We provide a
few helper routines to create quaternions about the principal axes, convert
quaternions to rotation matrices, and to rotate points (using
[scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html)
under the hood):
```python
>>> import pyb_utils
>>> q = pyb_utils.quatz(np.pi / 2) # 90 deg rotation about z-axis
>>> q
array([0., 0., 0.70710678, 0.70710678])

>>> pyb_utils.quaternion_to_matrix(q)  # convert to rotation matrix
array([[-0.,  -1.,  0.],
       [ 1.,  -0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,   0.,  1.]])

>>> pyb_utils.quaternion_multiply(q, q)  # rotate two quaternions together
array([0, 0, 1, 0])                      # 180 deg rotate about z

>>> pyb_utils.quaternion_rotate(q, [1, 0, 0])  # rotate a point
array([0, 1, 0])
```

Second, we provide a simple class to quickly create rigid bodies
programmatically, which is useful for adding basic objects to manipulate or act
as obstacles:
```python
>>> import pybullet as pyb
>>> import pyb_utils

>>> pyb.connect(pyb.GUI)

# create a 1x1x1 cube at the origin
>>> box = pyb_utils.BulletBody.box(position=[0, 0, 0], half_extents=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5])

# put a ball on top
>>> ball = pyb_utils.BulletBody.sphere(position=[0, 0, 1.5], radius=0.5)

# now put it somewhere else
>>> ball.set_pose(position=[2, 0, 0.5])
```

Third, we wrap some PyBullet functions to return *named* tuples, rather than
normal tuples. When the tuples have 10+ fields in them, it is rather helpful to
have names! The names and arguments of these functions are the same as the
underlying PyBullet ones, to make swapping effortless. Continuing our previous
example:
```python
# built-in PyBullet method
# the output is not easy to read!
>>> pyb.getDynamicsInfo(box.uid, -1)
(1.0,
 0.5,
 (0.16666666666666666, 0.16666666666666666, 0.16666666666666666),
 (0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
 (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0),
 0.0,
 0.0,
 0.0,
 -1.0,
 -1.0,
 2,
 0.001)

# switch to the pyb_utils version
# now we can access fields by name
>>> info = pyb_utils.getDynamicsInfo(box.uid, -1)
>>> info.mass
1.0
>>> info.localInertiaDiagonal
(0.16666666666666666, 0.16666666666666666, 0.16666666666666666),
```
The functions we've wrapped in this way are `getClosestPoints`,
`getConstraintInfo`, `getContactPoints`, `getDynamicsInfo`, `getJointInfo`,
`getJointState(s)`, and `getLinkState(s)`. There are two differences from the
vanilla PyBullet API. The first is that in pyb_utils `getJointInfo` also
accepts an optional argument `decode`, which will convert the byte strings
returned by PyBullet to the specified encoding. For example, `decode="utf8"`.
The second difference is that in pyb_utils `getLinkState(s)` will always return
`LinkState` tuples with 8 fields, even if `computeLinkVelocity=False`. When
`computeLinkVelocity=False`, then `worldLinkLinearVelocity` and
`worldLinkAngularVelocity` are both set to `None`.

And there's more! You can find example scripts of all of this package's
utilities in the `examples/` directory:

* [rigid bodies](examples/bodies_example.py)
* [camera](examples/camera_example.py)
* [collision detection](examples/collision_detection_example.py)
* [ghost objects](examples/ghost_object_example.py)
* [named tuples](examples/named_tuples_example.py)
* [video](examples/video_example.py)

## Video Output
Writing a video with the `VideoRecorder` defaults to using the `mp4v` codec,
which is widely supported but (at least on my computer running Ubuntu 20.04)
does not play natively in web browsers. The availability of codecs depends on
what is compiled into the version of OpenCV you have installed (i.e., the one
backing the `cv2` Python module); using an alternative codec may require a
different version of OpenCV.

## Known issues
Feel free to open issues (or better yet, a pull request!) if you find a
problem. Currently known issues:

* Ghost objects sometimes flicker (spooky, but undesirable). This is probably
  because they are updated by directly changing the object pose; we cannot
  have them updated automatically by, e.g., constraints since they are not
  dynamic objects (and we wouldn't want them to be; then they would influence
  the simulation).
* The field name `localInerialPos` in the `DynamicsInfo` named tuple is spelled
  incorrectly. This will be fixed in a future major version.
* The deprecated `GhostSphere` class will be removed in a future major version.
  Use `GhostObject.sphere` instead.

## Development

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is used for managing dependencies, testing,
building, and publishing. Create a virtual environment for the project:
```
uv venv
uv sync --dev
```
Run the tests:
```
uv run pytest
```
Run the tests for various Python versions:
```
# for example, test with Python 3.8 (in an isolated environment)
uv run --locked --isolated --python=3.8 pytest
```

Sphinx is used to build the documentation. With Sphinx installed, run `make
html` in the `docs` directory.
